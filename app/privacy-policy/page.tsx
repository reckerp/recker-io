            <p className='p__basic'>
                Web analytics (also referred to as &quot;reach measurement&quot;) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to our
                online offer and may include behavior, interests or demographic information about the visitors, such as the
                age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of reach analysis, we can, for example.
                recognize at what time our online offer or its functions or content are most frequently used or
                invite re-use. Likewise, we can understand which areas require optimization.
                <br />
                In addition to web analytics, we may also use testing procedures, for example, to test different versions of our
                online offer or its components and optimize them.
